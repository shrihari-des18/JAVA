Welcome to my personal repository for learning and mastering Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). This project is a collection of my work, ranging from fundamental programming concepts to advanced algorithms and applications.

## 🌟 About This Repository

> This repository serves as a practical log of my journey through the world of Java programming. It is structured to cover a wide array of topics, reinforcing my understanding through hands-on coding. Each folder represents a different concept or data structure, containing source code that implements and explores its nuances.

## 📚 Modules & Concepts Covered

> This repository is a comprehensive collection of my solutions and implementations for various DSA and Java concepts. Below is a detailed breakdown of the topics explored within each module.

### 🚀 Core Java Fundamentals
*   **Basics:** Covers the building blocks of Java, including **variables**, **primitive and non-primitive data types**, **type casting**, and capturing **user input**.
*   **Conditionals & Loops:** Explores control flow through **`if-else`** chains, **`switch`** statements, and **ternary operators**. Implements loops (**`for`**, **`while`**, **`do-while`**) for solving problems like factorial calculation, pattern printing, and number series generation (**AP**, **GP**, **Fibonacci**).
*   **Methods:** Focuses on creating **modular** and **reusable code** by defining and calling methods.

### 🏛️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
*   **Core Principles:** Deep dive into the four pillars of OOP:
    *   **Inheritance:** Building class hierarchies to reuse attributes and methods.
    *   **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.
    *   **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods that work on the data within one unit.
    *   **Polymorphism:** Allowing methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon (e.g., **method overriding** and **dynamic method dispatch**).
*   **Key Concepts:** Explores the **`super`** and **`static`** keywords, **constructors**, and **access modifiers**.
*   **Interfaces:** Demonstrates the use of interfaces for achieving **full abstraction** and **multiple inheritance of type**.

### 💡 Advanced Java Topics
*   **Exception Handling:** Covers **`try-catch`** blocks, the **`throw`** and **`throws`** keywords, creating **custom exceptions**, and using **`try-with-resources`** for automatic resource management.
*   **Concurrency:** Introduces multithreading by extending the **`Thread`** class and implementing the **`Runnable`** interface. Explores thread priorities, the **`sleep()`** method, and potential issues like **race conditions**.
*   **Modern Java:** Touches upon functional programming with **Lambda expressions** and the use of **Enumerations (`enum`)** for type-safe constants.
*   **Collections & APIs:** Introduction to the **Collections Framework**, **`Comparator`** and **`Comparable`** for custom sorting logic, and the **Stream API** for data processing.

### 💾 Data Structures
*   **Arrays:** A thorough exploration of array manipulations, including:
    *   Searching (**Linear Search**) and Sorting.
    *   Reversing, rotating, and finding duplicate elements.
    *   Problems like sorting **0s and 1s**, finding **max/min values**, and identifying **palindromic subarrays**.
*   **ArrayList:** Practical use of **`java.util.ArrayList`** and its dynamic methods.
*   **Linked Lists:** Implementation of a **singly linked list** from scratch. Solutions for common problems like **reversing a list**, **finding the middle element**, **removing the Nth node from the end**, and detecting **happy numbers**.
*   **Stacks & Queues:** Covers the basic implementation and use of **Stack** and **Queue** data structures, including the **`Deque`** interface.
*   **2D Arrays:** Working with **matrices** and **grids**.

### 🧠 Algorithms
*   **Searching:**
    *   **Linear Search:** Basic sequential search.
    *   **Binary Search:** Efficient search on sorted arrays, with applications in finding the **lower/upper bound**, the **square root of a number**, and **peak elements**.
*   **Sorting:**
    *   **Fundamental Algorithms:** In-depth implementation of **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, and **Insertion Sort**.

[//]: # (    *   **Advanced Algorithms:** Divide-and-conquer strategies with **Merge Sort** and the selection algorithm **QuickSelect**.)
*   **Recursion:** Problem-solving using recursive thinking, applied to **factorial**, **Fibonacci sequence**, printing array elements, calculating **powers**, and finding **paths in a maze**.

### 🎮 Mini-Applications & Games
*   **Practical Tools:** A collection of small but useful applications:
    *   `PasswordGenerator`: Creates random, strong passwords.
    *   `CipherGenerator`: Simple text encryption/decryption.
    *   `Captcha`: A basic CAPTCHA generator.
*   **Console Games:** Fun, interactive games to play in the terminal:
    *   `NumberGuessing`: A classic guess-the-number game.
    *   `RockPaperScissors`: The timeless hand game against the computer.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is set up as an IntelliJ IDEA project, as indicated by the `.idea` and `.iml` files. The easiest way to get started is to open the root `JAVA` folder in IntelliJ IDEA and use the IDE's features to compile and run the individual files.
